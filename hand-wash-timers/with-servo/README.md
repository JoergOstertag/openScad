Hand Wash Timer Build with a Servo
==================================


This is an example Project with the intention to inspire beginners to start playing arround with embedded devices.

In times of Covid-19 this device will give you a hint how long you should wash your hands.

If you get closer to the sonar distance sensor a timer starts 
and counts down from 20seconds to zero.

Displaing the timer is done with a standard Servo
